Vision API Module Take Home Assignment
==============

Writing iOS app that utilizes [Vision](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision) and [VisionKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionkit/) modules to scan and retrieve text from images.

### A few hiccups

APIs can only work with clear text, hence detecting handwritten notes may be a challenge

Scanning of receipts is not accurate for all formats.


### How it's built

* Technologies used
    * [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
    * [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit)
    * [Vision](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision)
    * [VisionKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionkit/)

* Architecture
    * MVC - Model View Controller


### Screenshots

I added some screenshots in the `screenshots` folder, in the root directory of the project. Added some GIFs to also show end to end test on the app
